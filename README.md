# Fetch Covid Turkey Data Daily

This repository fetches Turkey covid data daily and writes the numbers to `turkey_covid.csv`. 

If you want to fetch the Turkey covid data daily, just fork the repo and change the `cron:` in the [update.yml](https://github.com/ocakhasan/fetch_covid_daily/blob/master/.github/workflows/update.yml)
to the times you want the code to run.
